Data used for the figures included in "Detection of Axial Locations of Control Rods Using Movable In Core Detectors" - Paper presented at ANS Student Conference 2024

Due to the sensitive nature of raw operation data and core monitoring tools from a running power plant, only normalized results are shared here. This project contains the following underlying data:
•	Data file “RMS_database.pickle” contains position-wise RMS results for simulation to measurement agreement as shown in Figure 4.
•	Data file “FM2_SIMULATE.pickle” and “FM2_MEASURED.pickle” contain position-wise simulated and measured normalized detector traces for FM2.
•	Data file “FM21_SIMULATE.pickle” and “FM21_MEASURED.pickle” contain position-wise simulated and measured normalized detector traces for FM21.
•	Data file “FM50_SIMULATE.pickle” and “FM50_MEASURED.pickle” contain position-wise simulated and measured normalized detector traces for FM50.
•	Data file “XENON21.pickle” contains normalized xenon axial profile for different depletion strategies as described in the Results section.
